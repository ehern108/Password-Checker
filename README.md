## Project Overview 
This project is a Password Strength Checker built with Python. The program takes a password as input, evaluates its strength, and returns a score along with feedback on how the password can be improved. The evaluation is based on factors such as password length, character variety, and common security weaknesses.

The purpose of this project is to apply basic Python concepts while working on a practical problem related to cybersecurity and everyday technology use.



## Project Process ✍🏽
I started this project by breaking the problem down into smaller parts. First, I decided what makes a password strong or weak, such as length, use of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, and whether the password is commonly used.

From there, I created a scoring system that assigns points to each of these factors. I also added penalties for patterns that are known to make passwords easier to guess, such as repeated characters or simple sequences. Once the logic was complete, I focused on making the output easy to read and understand for the user.

Throughout the process, I tested the program multiple times with different types of passwords to make sure the scoring and feedback made sense.



## Why I Built This Project ❓
I built this project to practice Python fundamentals and to get more comfortable writing logical, rule-based programs. As a freshman IT student, I wanted to work on something that connects programming with real-world security concepts.

This project also helped me think more like a team member by writing code that is readable, organized, and easy for someone else to understand or modify.



## Tools & Technologies Used 🧰
- Python 3  
- PyCharm (IDE)  
- Python standard libraries (`re` for pattern matching)


## What I Learned 💭
Through this project, I learned how to:
- Break a problem into smaller, manageable steps
- Use conditional logic and pattern matching in Python
- Design a basic scoring system
- Write clearer code and explanations for others to follow



## What Can Be Improved 👍
There are several areas where this project could be improved in the future:
- Add hidden password input for terminals that support it
- Implement a simple graphical user interface (GUI)
- Expand the list of common passwords or connect to an external database
- Add unit tests to improve reliability
- Refactor the code as my Python skills improve
